## Project thoughts

I might look at data on party affiliation in the 2016, 2020, and 2024 elections. The 2020 and 2024 elections were/are very charged, with many people discussing them. It would be interesting to see whether there was a large jump in party affiliation between the 2016 and 2020 elections, and then if there was another jump in between the 2020 and 2024 elections.
